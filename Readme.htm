<h1>Divisor</h1>

<p>
	Divisor shows you how much each item in a stack costs at the auction house.&nbsp; 
	For example, if there were 5 crystallized fire available for a 12g 50s buyout, 
	Divisor would inform you that each crystallized fire would cost you 2g 50s, and 
	that 10 of them would cost you 25g.</p>
<h2>
	Installing Divisor</h2>
<p>
	Divisor is installed like pretty much every other World of Warcraft mod on the 
	planet.&nbsp; Extract the contents of the zip file to your Add-ons folder, 
	generally located here:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons</code></p>
<h2>Trying out Divisor</h2>
<p>To try out Divisor, visit an auction house, and search for something that&#39;s 
typically sold in stacks.&nbsp; For example, try searching for &quot;healing potion&quot;.&nbsp; 
Then, hover over the price of any stack of healing potions (more than one).&nbsp; 
Divisor will tell you the per-unit cost in a tooltip on the right.&nbsp; There&#39;s 
nothing you need to do to turn on Divisor or configure it; when it&#39;s installed, 
it&#39;s working.</p>
<p>The numbers you see may occasionally be a little different from what you&#39;re 
expecting.&nbsp; The most likely cause for this is that Divisor automatically 
factors the minimum bid increment into the calculations.&nbsp; Take this 
example: Let&#39;s say there are 2 Arcane Tomes for sale, at a price of 28g 1s, or 
29g buyout.&nbsp; You may initially expect Divisor to tell you that the 
bid for 1 would be 14g 50c, since that&#39;s half of 28g 1s.&nbsp; However, someone 
has already bid the minimum on these, so you&#39;d have to increase the bid to at 
least 29g 41s, 5% more than the current price.&nbsp; That&#39;s more than the 
buyout.&nbsp; So, Divisor doesn&#39;t even display a minimum bid amount, and just 
displays &quot;Buyout 15g 50s&quot;.&nbsp; Since you probably installed Divisor to help 
you get better deals on odd-sized stacks of items, it&#39;s showing you the exact 
per-unit amount it would cost you to either bid the least amount possible, or 
buy the item outright.</p>
<p>Certain items are mostly useful in stacks.&nbsp; This includes the various 
primal motes (Mote of Fire), enchanting lesser essences (Lesser Astral Essence), 
and rep items (Sanguine Hibiscus).&nbsp; For some of these items, in addition to 
the single item price, Divisor will tell you the cost to buy a stack of them.&nbsp; 
The stack size depends on the item—enchanting essences &quot;stack&quot; to 3 (even though 
a stack technically holds more than 3), motes &quot;stack&quot; to 10, since that&#39;s how 
many it takes to make a primal, and so forth.</p>
<h2>Slash commands</h2>
<p>Divisor supports a few slash commands that you can type into chat to 
customize Divisor.</p>
<h3>Adding a new item to be stacked</h3>
<p>Divisor automatically gives you individual prices for all items in the 
auction house, and stacked prices for certain items.&nbsp; For example, if 
someone were selling 3 Mote of Fire, Divisor would show you the price for 1 Mote 
of Fire, as well as 10 Mote of Fire.&nbsp; If you want to add your own items for 
Divisor to show stack prices, you can use the /divisor stack command.</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/divisor stack <i>number [item]<br />
	</i>/divisor stack 20 [Netherweave Cloth]<br />
	/divisor stack 20 Silk Cloth</code></p>
<ul>
	<li>The stack size must be at least 2.&nbsp; (Divisor always shows you 
	prices for individual items.)</li>
	<li>The item can either be simply the name of an item, or an item link that 
	you&#39;ve shift-clicked.&nbsp; In the above example, you could get Divisor to 
	show you prices of Netherweave in stacks of 20 if you typed &quot;/divisor stack 
	20&quot; and then shift-clicked on a stack of Netherweave.</li>
	<li>If you already have a stack size set for that item, using the command 
	again will change the stack size to the new one.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Removing stacking for an item</h3>
<p>You can undo the effects of the /divisor stack command by using the /divisor 
unstack command.</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/divisor unstack <i>[item]<br />
	</i>/divisor unstack [Netherweave Cloth]<br />
	/divisor unstack Silk Cloth</code></p>
<ul>
	<li>Rules for what&#39;s allowed for the item name are exactly as in the 
	/divisor stack command.</li>
	<li>You can also use this to remove stacking for items that came 
	pre-stacked.&nbsp; For example, you could use this command on Mote of Fire, 
	which Divisor stacks to 10 by default.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resetting all Divisor options</h3>
<p>If you&#39;ve really screwed up and want to go back to the default Divisor 
options, you can use /divisor reset.</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/divisor reset</code></p>
<ul>
	<li>This deletes all of your custom stack sizes.&nbsp; You&#39;ll need to 
	reenter them all again if you reset your Divisor options.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Listing all of your stack sizes</h3>
<p>You can see all of the stack sizes you have set (as well as all of the ones 
that came with Divisor) using the /divisor list stacks command.</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/divisor list stacks</code></p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3>Contacting the author</h3>
<p>I welcome your feedback.&nbsp; The best way to contact me is through the
Divisor page on
<a href="https://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/divisor.aspx" target="_blank">
Curse</a>, or on <a href="https://facebook.com/vgermods">Facebook</a>.&nbsp; 
Also, check out my
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.vgermods.com/">official site</a>, with links

<h3>Reporting bugs</h3>
<p>When reporting bugs, it&#39;s helpful to be as specific as possible.&nbsp; By 
default, WoW hides mod error information from you.&nbsp; Enabling &quot;Show Lua 
Errors&quot; in 
Interface Options would 
be helpful; the error text includes useful information about where the error 
occurred.&nbsp; Installing a mod like <a href="http://auctioneeraddon.com/dl/" target="_blank">Swatter</a>
can provide even more useful error information that can help Vger track down the bug.</p>
<h2>Known problems</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Divisor does not work properly with Auctioneer when Compact UI is 
	enabled (the default).&nbsp; It&#39;s not really 
	useful if you have Auctioneer anyway.</li>
	<li><i>See the &quot;future versions&quot; section 
for things that aren&#39;t necessarily bugs but I might improve someday.</i></li>
</ul>
<h2>Release history</h2>

</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.7</h3>

	for Cataclysm enchanting materials if you&#39;ve used Divisor in the past.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem that started occurring in a recent patch where after

</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the last item on the Bid and Auction tabs wouldn&#39;t get 
	a Divisor tooltip.&nbsp; (Browse only shows 8 items; the other two tabs show 
	9, but only the top 8 would get a Divisor tooltip.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated for patch 3.0.</li>
	<li>Now works on all three tabs (Browse, Bid, Auctions).</li>
	<li>Added various Northrend items (Crystallized Life, Lesser Cosmic Essence, 
	...) to the list of items that Divisor will automatically show stack prices 
	for, but to get them, you must use &quot;/divisor reset&quot; and clear out any custom 
	stacks that you may have set, if any.</li>
	<li>Divisor now uses icons for gold, silver, and copper instead 
	of the letters g, s, and c respectively.</li>
	<li>Divisor now has an entry in Interface Options in case you forget how to 
	type &quot;/divisor&quot;.</li>

	the time remaining display.</li>
	<li>Divisor disables the built-in Blizzard auction UI price per item 
	feature.</li>
	<li>Removed the &quot;Divisor is loaded&quot; message that was shown upon logging in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added more stacked items.</li>
	<li>Now displays a more readable error message when the embedded mod 
	VgerCore is missing or failed to load.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Divisor is now at version 1.0!&nbsp; It includes VgerCore 1.0 embedded 
	in the mod, so you don&#39;t need a separate VgerCore folder in your AddOns 
	folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added Divisor slash commands, and the ability to set custom stack sizes 
	for any item you like.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.1.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>More rep items added.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>More reputation-only items were added, such as Savage Frond, to the list 
	of items that will show both single prices and stack prices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Divisor now gives you stack prices for a small selection of items, such 
	as motes and lesser enchanting essences, as well as the single item prices.</li>
	<li>When you hover over an item that you&#39;re currently winning, Divisor now 
	shows &quot;Your bid&quot; instead of &quot;Minimum bid&quot; and doesn&#39;t factor in the minimum 
	increment.</li>
	<li>The /divisor slash command works now.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t do anything other 
	than tell you to read the readme, but someday it will be more useful, and it 
	won&#39;t give you an error anymore.</li>
	<li>Divisor will now properly check the version of VgerCore that you have 
	installed.&nbsp; Currently, 0.4.1 is required.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>First release of Divisor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future versions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I'm considering adding an option to turn off the feature that hides values from the tooltip
	when they're the same stack size as the item for sale.  For example, when 1 mote of fire is sold,
	the tooltip only shows the prices for 10 motes of fire, instead of both 1 and 10, which is what you
	see if you hover over 5 of them.  Some people might find this distracting.&nbsp; 
	(However, nobody&#39;s really complained yet.)</li>
</ul>
